				<h3>Observations</h3>

					Mike was astonished that many businesses lack management training, very seldom provide leadership training, and offer negligible coaching training. We are always too busy is an accepted argument.
					The training attempted was commonly complimentary from a vendor to sell their merchandise exclusively.
					The major resource of manufacture driven initiatives tended to be a one dimensional solution.
					 Mike developed his plan to assist others prosper by contributing experience and best practices of automotive dealers. His goal is to look at the entire dealership through the eyes of the consumer in order to provide an exceptional customer experience that will capitalize on every revenue stream realistic for your store with regard to its situation and way of life.</p>

					<h4>Bottom Line</h4>
						<p>Long term profitability and customer experience are a click away.</p>
